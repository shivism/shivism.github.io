  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln1">
    <p>At the beginning, after constructing reality, Shiv sat alone in the universe. The universe as Shiv knew it was an unstable place – nothing to see but himself, and nothing beyond him. Shiv, with his gift of wisdom, created balance as a way to instate stability to the universe, in order to prevent a universal collapse. Once balance was added to the universe, it formed the four core elements of reality: Void, Fate, Truth, and Chaos. At the command of Shiv, Void created all light, the sun, and the earth, while Fate gave way to the sky, the harvest, and the rain. Truth then created life, wisdom, and luck, while Chaos constructed time, peace, and war. From these holy elements, humanity was born. At the realm of the deities, Shiv sat and watched the humans as they started life.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln2">
    <p>The humans began as a primitive race but evolved quickly, settling in a couple of different villages near the ancient human homeland, a vast uncharted territory composed mostly of desert. However, as Shiv watched the humans from above, he realized that the universe was not complete, and that the humans needed divine intervention to be able to prosper and advance. Humanity was stuck at a standstill, and Shiv could not figure out why. He decided to come down to earth, disguised as an old man. He walked for two days through the desert, seeking a human settlement, until he came across the village of Tzelopa. Two humans came to greet him at the entrance to the village, named Neaniv and Chailiu. Shiv spoke to the two beings, who explained that they did not know how to collect water, food, tools, and clothing easily. The village was in the center of the arid expanse, impassable and unreachable to normal humans.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln3">
    <p>Neaniv told Shiv that it had not rained in days, and if it did not rain soon it would mean the end for the humans. Shiv asked the two for a home to stay in for a short while, expecting them to say that they had no homes left, but the two immediately led him to a simple mud hut to stay in. Shocked at their kindness, Shiv told them to walk outside again, and as they did they felt drops of rain, then a drizzle. As the villagers danced in celebration of the miracle of rain, Neaniv and Chailiu looked on at the old man with curiosity, realizing that he knew it would rain when they walked outside.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln4">
    <p>Shiv called them both back into the mud hut, and told them the full tale of his creation of the universe, and how he controlled all that happened on Earth. Neaniv, doubtful, asked for proof. All Shiv had to do was speak the words, “I command the rain to stop,” and it was done. Neaniv and Chailiu ran around the village, telling the story of Shiv and his wisdom, and how he had brought the rain in his infinite kindness. Shiv proclaimed Neaniv and Chailiu the prophets of his story for their kindness in providing him a home. Shiv then gifted the two with the prophecy, not to be shared with anyone but themselves. The next day Shiv was nowhere to be seen, and all that remained of him on Earth was his legend and his prophecy. Shiv knew that all the humans needed to prosper was his guidance, through the teachings of his prophets.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln5">
    <p>Quickly, his teachings gained a mass following, and Tzelopa became the central city for this new religion. Under the joint-leadership of Neaniv and Chailiu, Tzelopa began to politically absorb many other small villages, until the empire controlled all of the desert homeland. Under the guidance of Shiv and the leadership of the prophets, humans began to craft better tools, make better clothing, and find food and water more efficiently. However, the empire could not stay under the same leadership forever, and once Neaniv and Chailiu grew old, they needed successors to rule the grand empire, and they chose three men who had fought for the empire in battle: Ronatz, Saloszin, and Ilenad, who promised to rule by the teachings of Shiv, and only by the teachings of Shiv.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln6">
    <p>Because of their kindness, Shiv made sure that Neaniv and Chailiu’s lives ended peacefully, marked with festivals honoring their devotion to Shiv and their spreading of his word. Many others also dedicated their lives to Shiv as priests or ceremonial leaders, each with a different story of what Shiv prophesied to Neaniv and Chailiu on his third day on Earth. According to popular ancient legend, Shiv is always walking the earth in some human form, continuing to spread his teachings as a priest and keeping his identity a secret.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr1:ln7">
    <p>Under the reign of Ronatz, Saloszin, and Ilenad, the empire achieved prosperity which had never been seen before. Though the three leaders had their flaws, the empire continued to grow, and the leaders began to prioritize technology over Shiv. Soon, this would prove to be a mistake for the empire.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln1">
    <p>During the Golden Age, Shiv, in his infinite wisdom, begins to notice some suspicion arising from the humans. To test their faith, he calls Ronatz, Saloszin, and Ilenad, the three kings of Tzelopa. He gives them a sapphire, telling them it holds all their deepest desires, but that they can only get what’s inside the gem by never tarnishing it and being forever faithful.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln2">
    <p>The three of course agree and bow down, but the second they return to Ronatz’s palace, they scoff and snicker. “What a fool Shiv is!” they proclaim! They call their wives, the queens, and tell them how Shiv has instructed them to never tarnish the gem that holds their deepest desires… in order to obtain said desires?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln3">
    <p>They all laugh at the absurdity of such a statement, and Laliea, the wife of Ilenad, exclaims, “Well, what are you fools waiting for? The infinite riches that we all so deeply crave lie within that gem!” And so, with only the tiniest bit of trepidation, they begin to try to open it. They use stone, daggers, claws, teeth, everything imaginable, and all things unfathomable. Nothing works, nothing at all.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln4">
    <p>They know there must be some way, aside from being faithful and true, so they visit a priest. The kings ask him, “How do we open this gem?” The priest warns them to never open it, pleads with them, even, but the kings threaten to have the priest beheaded for treason, and thus he is forced to oblige, if only to keep the sacred word of Shiv on the Earth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln5">
    <p>The priest tells them, weeping and begging all the while, that in order to open the gem, they must reach the highest point attainable to man, on foot, let the gem bask in the purest ray of sunshine, just before dusk, and allow the gem to bathe in the holiest ray of moonlight, just before dawn. The kings grumble and shout, but eventually, they leave, determined to unlock the sacred sapphire. They argue and clamor for six full days before deciding on where this tallest point may lie. Their answer is none other than Mount Azaena — the peak directly below the realm of the gods.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln6">
    <p>In their infinite hubris, they set upon their journey fully expecting to triumph. Now, these men are quite lazy, but the only thing that trumps their sloth is their endless greed, and thus, they don’t order servants to help them in their journey, for fear that they may end up getting a share of the wealth.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr2:ln7">
    <p>They begin their trek immediately, hiking day and night for twelve rzanale, their avarice fueling them. They climb, and the best years of their life, their entire youth, flutter away like leaves in the autumn wind. Their sons and daughters blossom into adults and become leaders in the stead of their fathers; their wives grieve them, but remarry. Still, they go on, oblivious to any and all surroundings.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln1">
    <p>Finally, the kings had reached the summit. Finally, they had achieved their goal. Finally, the only thing left to do was wait for dusk before pulling out the priceless gem. The three old men all sit, impatiently watching the sun sink ever closer to the horizon. At last, the time has come, and they hurry to pull out the divine gift in time. The once beautiful, shining, colorful sapphire had morphed into a dull and nearly opaque amber, for this is a magical gem, after all — it only stays as beautiful as the souls which hold it. The once-kings pay no attention to the state of the gem — they’re too consumed with anticipation to notice anything at all was wrong.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln2">
    <p>They all hold it high above their heads as the purest ray of sun hits. The gem glows, but only a fraction of the brilliant shine it would’ve displayed if held by worthy people. They quickly stow it away in one of their bags, careful not to allow it to be hit by another ray of sun, and see through the thin fabric of the bag a faint, pulsing light. They repeat the process right before dawn, and the precious stone shone marginally brighter, before eventually floating up.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln3">
    <p>As the men watch on in awe, bright beams stream from the amber in all directions. It splits cleanly down the middle, allowing an orange-tinted plume to arise from the fracture. The cloud begins to form distinct shapes, but things quickly take an awful, unexpected turn. An earsplitting cacophony of screeches and cackles sound from the stone, and the men quickly realize they would not be receiving riches, youth, charm, beauty, or glory, today.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln4">
    <p>The smoke clears and the shapes come into clarity. Before the men stand five gruesome creatures. They open their mouths and speak as one.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln5">
    <p>“Why are you so frightened? We are nothing but what festers inside your very souls. We are only your truest reflection.” The men are paralyzed with fear, and thus, their only option is to survey the beasts before them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln6">
    <p>The first is Greed. It’s scaly, and a horrible, muddy green color, with grotesque, yellow claws, and teeth and eyes to match them. It has enormous, white feathered wings that look far too pure for it, but one glance at the jagged pink marks where they grow from, and one can tell they never belonged to the thing. Greed cocks its head and smiles at the shaking hypocrites. A blood red, forked tongue flicks in and out of a black, gaping maw.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln7">
    <p>The next is Hubris. She is a woman draped in golden silk. She has a hand on her hip and a smirk on her lips. She tosses her hair behind her shoulder.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln8">
    <p>The eyes of the mortals shift to Vanity. There’s a dark cloud of movement enveloping it, so the onlookers can barely see the small figure inside, crouched down and hiding its eyes as hands fly around it, attacking it, trying to “fix” its appearance.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln9">
    <p>Stricken, they move on to take in the frightening sight that is Paranoia. He’s sitting on the ground, rapidly shuffling backwards, ever closer to the edge of the cliff. He clutches something close to his body, and his head whips back and forth, never failing to look up as well. He has dark, purple bags under his eyes, and sickly, pallid skin, but most disturbingly of all, he looks simply like an ordinary human.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln10">
    <p>Their sights finally befall Perfidiousness. They’re slightly hunched forward, a malicious glint in their eyes. They look sharp and sport a suit in the front, but the men catch glimpses of a slithering tail behind the creature.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln11">
    <p>“We are nothing but what you are, and you are nothing what we are,” hisses Greed, gesturing to its kin. Suddenly, it lurches forward, snatching the humans before pivoting in mid-air and beating its wings steadily, moving swiftly towards the edge of the cliff. These humans, who are the worst of their race, who have now unleashed immortalized versions of their traits on the entire world, have the audacity to try and negotiate.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln12">
    <p>“Please! Please, don’t! We’ll be better!” Whimpers the first man.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln13">
    <p>“We’ll be kind! We’ll be selfless!” Promises the second.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln14">
    <p>“We’ll respect Shiv! We’ll teach and praise his holy name!” Offers the third.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln15">
    <p>“We beg you!” The three plead in unison. A derisive laugh erupts from Hubris.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln16">
    <p>“Oh, it’s far too late for that. Shiv gave you every opportunity to better yourselves, but now he knows humans cannot appreciate the good and holy without being afflicted by the truly evil. Now, the world shall be improved, and everyone will finally learn to be grateful. Everyone will live their lives to the fullest. Thank you.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln17">
    <p>As the men wail and thrash, Greed muses, “What a curious sight this is. Three men, once the most powerful men in the entire land — men who bowed to nothing and no one but their own reflections — so suddenly became the most religious and holy men you could ever dream of.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr3:ln18">
    <p>It looks down at his victims, and the words it speaks are the last they’ll ever hear before plummeting to their deaths: “How quickly a hawk becomes a sparrow, when pointed at with a bow and an arrow.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln1">
    <p>When it was clear to the people of Tzelopa that the three kings would never return from their journey, their heirs, Arenon, Osalovis, and Chelam, took control in their place. It was evident that they had many differences between them, and every citizen had a favorite they supported.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln2">
    <p>Ruling as a benevolent oligarchy worked wonderfully for the first ten years, but throughout, the tensions between the kings had begun to build. Each wanted different things for their country, and one day, an argument that there was no going back from broek out. This sparked the Great Civil War of Tzelopa, in which the country split into three states, each developing their chosen technological focus. Arenon’s state was highly irreligious, with a focus on machinist and intellectual jobs, while Osalovis’ state was highly religious and was an agrarian society. Finally, Chelam’s state was an anarchist dystopia, with no real leadership. Because of this, there was no single focus, but many people turned to music.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln3">
    <p>The heirs, wanting total power over their respective empires, grasped for any control they could find over the people. Things would be going well for a while, and citizens would get too confident. Plots to overthrow the government arose. The leaders were intelligent — they knew that without food and progression, the population would have bigger things to worry about than tyranny. With this logic, they began the Demise, destroying crops and enslaving entire populations. Wisdom and Luck became obsolete, now controlled by leadership and government, followed by the Harvest and Rain being harnessed for the leaders’ purposes as well. Finally, the energy of the Sun and the Earth were finally controlled by the great scientists. This strategy was ingenious: not only did the people simply not have the time to worry about their government, but it seemed to them as if the gods had abandoned them. What they didn’t realize, however, is that in their doubt, the gods had no choice but to slowly fade away, truly abandoning them now.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln4">
    <p>While the leaders took comfort in their absolute power of their respective states, their sons, Lareskaz, Spalora, and Kazchara, began to plot. After all, they were the only ones unaffected by the horrors their fathers inflicted upon their countries, and thus were the only ones with any chance to overthrow their fathers. They spoke to the people in secret, vowing to reunite the three states and bring peace and comfort to all. The citizens, eager to grasp any fragment of hope they could get, immediately helped the sons overthrow and kill their fathers.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln5">
    <p>As the third generation of leaders, the three signed a peace treaty, each with the secret intent to kill the others. The leaders agreed that their only true opposition was their subjects’ persistent beliefs in Shiv and the deities. Despite the fact that the lack of action from the gods caused many to turn to heresy, it did the opposite for some, acting as a light at the end of the tunnel. So, a law was passed which outlawed all worship of Shiv, and anyone caught praying would be executed. The reasoning that was given was that since the gods had clearly renounced them all, they clearly no longer cared about humanity, and must pay for their desertion. The citizens, eager to appease their new leaders, willingly agreed, and burned down the holy site of Tzelopa to show their loyalty, after which they established New Tzelopa, the capital of this united empire.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln6">
    <p>The new bloom in hope caused an economic and technological boom, leading to Life, Weather, Light, and even Time being able to be controlled by the new unstoppable government. Escape was impossible, and any outside settlements were quickly colonized. Only heretics could hold any power, and worshippers of Shiv that were not yet executed had to go into hiding.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote vrln="vr4:ln7">
    <p>Shiv’s distress with the humans continued to mount, and as a last resort, he came down to Earth for the last time. Disguised as a farmer, he walked from the rural fields to the newly established capital. He began to protest in the central square, among bustling crowds of people, about the cruelty of the government in recent times. However, no one turned to him with agreement or disagreement. Shiv quickly realized that the people could neither see nor hear him, a result of their loss of faith. He rushed to tell the deities the news, but when he returned, he was greeted with a barren Utaria. Truth and Fate had been eradicated, and the universe began to crumble. The balance had been broken, and a great flood was unleashed upon the Earth. Shiv was all that remained in the emptiness.</p>
